# Airtel_Internship

This repository describes my internship project at Bharti Airtel Limited, where I worked on developing an algorithm to identify optimal locations for new landlines using data science techniques. The project involved Python programming, data analysis, and Google Earth visualization to enhance telecommunication planning. My mentor was Mr. Vikas Bhatnagar (Big thanks to Mr. Vikas Bhatnagar for his mentorship and guidance throughout this project).

Note: This repository does not contain any private company information, including actual code or datasets. Instead, it provides an overview of the project, methods, and key learnings.
