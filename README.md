# Airtel_Internship

This repository describes my internship project at Bharti Airtel Limited, where I worked on developing an algorithm to identify optimal locations for new landlines using data science techniques. The project involved Python programming, data analysis, and Google Earth visualization to enhance telecommunication planning. My mentor was Mr. Vikas Bhatnagar (Big thanks to Mr. Vikas Bhatnagar for his mentorship and guidance throughout this project).



**New York Housing Prices Code:**
To demonstrate similar data science techniques in a publicly shareable way, I have included some code that applies the same principles to a different problem.
This code applies DBSCAN clustering to a dataset of New York real estate properties to group houses based on their locations and analyzes house pricing based on thier location.
It is intentionally designed to be easier to understand to show the core principles of clustering and Google Earth visualization, making it not as complex as the real-world telecom application I had coded during the internship.


color representation:
Green: Mid-range prices (Q1-Q3).
Red: Higher-priced properties.
Blue/Black: Lower-priced properties.


Libraries used in New_York_Housing_Prices.ipynb: sklearn, pandas, numpy, simplekml, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
Dataset: NY-House-Dataset.csv from Kaggle


How to run the code (using Google Colab):

1)Install required libraries, if not already installed, using pip install
2)Place NY-House-Dataset.csv in the google colabatory's files
3)Run the code, which will create polygon_with_colored_points.kml
4)Download polygon_with_colored_points.kml onto your computer's file system from the Google Colabatory's files
5)Upload polygon_with_colored_points.kml onto Google Earth to see the result

**Note**: This repository does not contain any private company information, such as actual code or datasets. Instead, it provides an overview of the project, methods, and key learnings.
